# Concept

I am creating a social network for wilders (students of my current school, Wild Code School). You can see some features of a simple social network (authentification, adding posts, etc.).

# Ongoing

On what you can see now there are some problems, I need to solve in the next weeks.

- ðŸŸ  the site design as you can see
- ðŸŸ¢ the check of values that are posted in database. I found some ideas to do that, I'm working on It (my priority)
- ðŸŸ  the check of values in frontend
- ðŸŸ¢ a new architecture for my code
- cache gestion

I also want to add new features.

- A little algorithm to recommend some posts.
- Possibility to update profile
- ðŸŸ  Possibility to upload file
- Possibility to comment posts
- ðŸŸ¢ Instant messaging 

And I also want to add "Run Project" section in this README.md file.
