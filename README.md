This project is ongoing. I wanted to push it on Github to show progress of my work. This is not a final version, or a MVP version.
This project is a personal project, additionally to my three school projects. Made in about 10 days.

Technologies

PHP/Symfony
JavaScript/React

Concept

I am creating a social network for wilders (students of my current school, Wild Code School). You can see some features of a simple social network (authentification, adding posts, etc.).

Ongoing

On what you can see now there are some problems, I need to solve in the next weeks.

- the site design as you can see
- the check of values that are posted in database. I found some ideas to do that, I'm working on It (my priority).

I also want to add new features :

- as a little algorithm to recommend some posts.
- a forum section
- upload of file
- the capacity to comment posts
- instant messaging ?
